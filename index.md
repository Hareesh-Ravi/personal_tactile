I am a Senior Applied Research Scientist at Adobe's Applied Research team working on language-vision research and Generative AI. I completed my PhD from the [CS](https://www.cs.rutgers.edu/) department at the [Intelligent Visual Interfaces](https://ivi.cs.rutgers.edu/) lab in [Rutgers University](http://newbrunswick.rutgers.edu/). My PhD thesis was on Multimodal Story Comprehension, under the supervision of [Dr. Mubbasir Kapadia](https://www.cs.rutgers.edu/~mk1353/) and [Dr. Gerard De Melo](http://gerard.demelo.org/). My research interests are on joint understanding of images/videos and abstract/narrative text with applications to multimodal story comprehension. Specificaly, story illustration, visual storytelling, image captioning and text-to-image retreival/generation. Recently, I have been working on Diffusion Models for Image generation and editing.

We are looking for summer research interns to work on image generation, editing problems. Reach to mevia email or linkedin if you are interested with your CV.
